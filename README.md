# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Use SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from a relational database.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- MySQL 

## ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
- `Ecommerce_SQL_Database`

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- SQL queries in a `.sql` file (`task3.sql`)

## ðŸ“š Skills & Concepts Covered
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- JOINS: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.
- Views for analysis

## ðŸ§  Outcome
This project provided hands-on experience with SQL for real-world data analysis tasks. Key outcomes include:

- Gained practical experience in querying relational databases using core SQL commands.
- Strengthened understanding of data filtering, grouping, and sorting techniques.
- Developed the ability to perform data aggregation using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.
- Learned to effectively join multiple tables using `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` JOINS to extract meaningful insights.
- Practiced writing subqueries to solve complex problems and improve query logic.
- Built a strong foundation for using SQL in data analysis, reporting, and decision-making workflows.
